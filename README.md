Operating Systems

Labs taken during Fall 2019

Lab 1: Understanding the creation of processes with Unix-like operating systems and the fork() system call

Lab 2: Learning how the MINIX OS operates by modifying the process scheduling algorithm and adding print statements beside the copyright banner upon its initialization.

Lab 3: Gaining experience with page replacement (and to a lesser extent, caching) algorithms. Wrote programs that simulate page replacement algorithms, specifically first in first out (FIFO), least recently used (LRU), and second chance (SC).
